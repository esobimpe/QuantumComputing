# QuantumComputing

It has recently been recognized, after decades of using the archetypes of classical physics to build a theory of computation, that quantum physics provides another prototype with clearly different and possibly much more powerful features than established computational theory.  Quantum computing is quite different from conventional computing and requires a lot of non-intuitive thinking and math.
Quantum computers work by applying quantum gates to quantum states. The evolution of quantum states is restricted by the unitary property of quantum mechanics, i.e. every operation on a normalized quantum state must keep the sum of probabilities of all possible outcomes at exactly 1. Any quantum gate must thus be implemented as a unitary operator and is therefore reversible.
Quantum computers are programmed using sequence of quantum gates of various kinds. As bits are used in classical computer as information carrier and they can either be 1 or 0, so are qubits (quantum bits) and they typically start life at 0.
