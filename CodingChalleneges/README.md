#1. Coin Flipping
Coin flipping, coin tossing, or heads or tails is the practice of throwing a coin in the air and checking which side is showing when it lands, in order to choose between two alternatives, sometimes used to resolve a dispute between two parties. It is a form of sortition which inherently has two possible outcomes. The party who calls the side wins.

The fundamental unit of Qiskit is the quantum circuit. To create a simple head and tail coin, you need to 1 qubit, and 1 classical bit (not necessary) , then create a circuit to act on them. Using the hadamard gate, you can set the circuit to superposition with two possible outcome, i.e 0, 1.

#2. 8 sided Dice
